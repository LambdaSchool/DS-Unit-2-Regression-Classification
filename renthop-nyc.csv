Inspired by the architecture of mid-century icons including Le Corbusier and Mies van der Rohe, and thoroughly updated for an effortlessly elevated 21st-century lifestyle, Hanley New York brings an unmistakably downtown edge to uptown living. The buildings original, namesake white glazed facade bricks  manufactured by Hanley Brick  are contrasted with new, black-glazed, subway-style bricks on accent walls throughout the ground level. Works of art by photographer Olaf Otto Becker and abstract painter Malcolm Hill are sophisticated complements to the Lobby by celebrated designers Enrico Bonetti and Shamir Shah. The amenities themselves are paired with white-glove services and tech-savvy features to offer residents every convenience along with a host of brilliantly contemporary luxuries.
