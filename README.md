# Lambda School Data Science - Unit 2 - Sprint 1


## Linear Models

Unit 2 is about Predictive Modeling, also known as supervised machine learning with labeled, tabular data!

We can make models to predict continuous numbers, and answer questions like “How much?” or “How many?” This modeling task is called regression.

We’ll begin our study of predictive modeling with linear models for regression tasks: ordinary least squares regression, and ridge regression.

We can also make models to predict discrete classes, and answer questions like “Is this A or B or C?” This modeling task is called classification.

We’ll continue our study of predictive modeling with a linear model for classification tasks, called logistic regression.
