    "- [ ] Do train/test split. Use data from April & May 2016 to train. Use data from June 2016 to test.\n",
    "- [ ] Engineer at  two new features. (See below for explanation & ideas.)\n",
    "- [ ] Fit a linear regression model with at least two features.\n",
    "- [ ] Get the model's coefficients and intercept.\n",
